        <h3>Vision</h3>
         <article>
          <p>
            De La Salle University-Dasmariñas is a Filipino Catholic University established and managed by the De La Salle Brothers and their lay partners in the historic province of Cavite in response to the needs of the Church and the Nation for human and Christian education, particularly the youth at risk.

            Guided by the Lasallian values of Faith, Zeal and Communion, the University participates meaningfully in the process of social transformation by forming God-centered, people-oriented, and patriotic persons who serve as responsible and professionally competent stewards of God's creation.
